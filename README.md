✌️ Hey there! Nice to meet you! I'm a Data & Software Engineer based in Chicago, Illinois, with a strong passion for *data-driven decision-making*, *web development*, and *AI/ML*.

I thrive at the intersection of *data analytics*, *software engineering*, and *user experience*, constantly exploring how technology can enhance functionality while remaining intuitive and user-centric. With expertise in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **SQL** and **Data Visualization**, I enjoy building intelligent systems, designing clean interfaces, and optimizing user interactions.

Outside of work, you’ll find me at Cinemas 🎬, exploring new food spots in Chicago, diving into photography 📸   , or tinkering with creative video edits in Premiere Pro. Oh, and if there’s Pizza involved, count me in! 🍕
